# Boston Elm Arcade

Games here are built by people at the Weekly Functional Programming Meetup or Elm Meetup in Boston!

Inspired by [boston-haskell-arcade](https://github.com/mitchellwrosen/boston-haskell-arcade) at the same Meetup

## Adding a game

Take a look at the `Main.elm` file. Its just a little boilerplate to add your
own game. You can use the directory structure laid out in `Snake` as a reference
if you choose.
